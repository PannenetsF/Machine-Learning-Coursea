\chapter{Anomaly Detection}


\section{Motivation}

To tell something is working anomalously. The center is \(p(x) < \epsilon\) .

For example, it could be applied to fraud detection. 

\section{Gaussian Distribution }

If \(x\) is a distributed Guassian with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\), it's \(x \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \)

With Guassian Distribution, we can estimate a dataset: 

\[\begin{aligned}
    \mu &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m x^{(i)} \\
    \sigma^2 &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (x^{(i)}-\mu)^2 
\end{aligned}\]

\section{Density Estimation} 

Every componets will be a normal distribution. 

\section{Developing and Evaluating an Anomaly Detection System}

If we have some labeled data, part of them are anomalous and non-anomalous. Then we can compute whether an example is normal or not.


\section{Multivariate Gaussian Distribution}

Model the \(x\) rather than \(x_i\) separately. Then \(\mu \in \mathbb{R}\) and \(\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\) .

\[p(x,\mu,\Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{1/2}|\Sigma|^{1/2}} \exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu))\] 

This could automatically captures correlations between features. (Need: \(m > 10 n\)) It's more expensive than original model.
